AWS CLI
-------
The AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) is an open-source tool that enables you to interact with AWS services using commands in your command-line shell. With minimal configuration, the AWS CLI enables you to start running commands that implement functionality equivalent to that provided by the browser-based AWS Management Console from the command prompt in your terminal program.

The AWS CLI is ideal for automation and scripting tasks, enabling the execution of repetitive tasks without manual intervention.

Installation and Configuration
------------------------------
Installation: The AWS CLI can be installed on Windows, macOS, and Linux. The installation process varies slightly depending on the operating system, but generally involves downloading the installation package from the AWS website or using a package manager.

Configuration: After installation, you need to configure the AWS CLI with your AWS credentials. This can be done using the aws configure command, which prompts you to enter your AWS Access Key ID, Secret Access Key, region, and output format (e.g., JSON).
    aws configure

    The AWS CLI uses a consistent syntax:
    For example, to list all S3 buckets, you can use:
      aws s3 ls
